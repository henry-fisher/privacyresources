# Henry's Privacy Resources üß†üîê
A list of resources to help me keep track of important news/studies/projects/etc. in the privacy & security world. This is designed for my own use, but I'm publicizing it as I believe much of it is information people should have access to. I will be putting everything here through the archive machine soon to ensure none of it is lost. This is a constant work in progress and is currently incomplete.
